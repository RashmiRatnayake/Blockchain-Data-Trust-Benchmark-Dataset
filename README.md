# Blockchain-Data-Trust-Benchmark-Dataset
This repository provides a benchmark dataset for using machine learning models for blockchain data trustworthiness. The data is categorized into three major dimensions of trust, each with 'balanced' and 'imbalanced' versions. Supporting Jupyter notebooks are included for data generation, labeling using weak supervision (Snorkel), and exporting.
